    <h3> Phases of clinical trials</h3><br>
     <p>A clinical trial is only done when there is good reason to believe that a new test or treatment may improve the
      care of patients. Before clinical trials, tests and treatments are assessed in preclinical research. Preclinical
      research is not done with people. It assesses the features of a test or treatment. For example, the research may
      aim to learn if a device is harmful to living tissue. Another aim may be to learn more about the chemical makeup
      of a drug.

            <h3>Phase-0</h3>
            <p>
              Phase 0 trials are the first clinical trials done among people. They aim to learn how a drug is processed
              in the body and how it affects the body. In these trials, a very small dose of a drug is given to about 10
              to 15 people

            <h3>Phase-I</h3>
            <p>
              Phase I trials aim to find the best dose of a new drug with the fewest side effects. The drug will be
              tested in a small group of 15 to 30 patients. Doctors start by giving very low doses of the drug to a few
              patients. Higher doses are given to other patients until side effects become too severe or the desired
              effect is seen. The drug may help patients, but Phase I trials are to test a drug’s safety. If a drug is
              found to be safe enough, it can be tested in a phase II clinical trial.

            <h3>Phase-II</h3>
            <p>
              Phase II trials further assess safety as well as if a drug works. The drug is often tested among patients
              with a specific type of cancer. Phase II trials are done in larger groups of patients compared to Phase I
              trials. Often, new combinations of drugs are tested. Patients are closely watched to see if the drug
              works. However, the new drug is rarely compared to the current (standard-of-care) drug that is used. If a
              drug is found to work, it can be tested in a phase III clinical trial.

            <p>
              Phase III trials further assess safety as well as if a drug works. The drug is often tested among patients
              with a specific type of cancer. Phase II trials are done in larger groups of patients compared to Phase I
              trials. Often, new combinations of drugs are tested. Patients are closely watched to see if the drug
              works.

            <h3>Phase-IV</h3>
            <p>
              Phase IV trials test new drugs approved by the FDA. The drug is tested in several hundreds or thousands of
              patients. This allows for better research on short-lived and long-lasting side effects and safety. For
              instance, some rare side effects may only be found in large groups of people. Doctors can also learn more
              about how well the drug works and if it’s helpful when used with other treatments.

  <!-- Approval Process of Vaccine-->
        <h2>Vaccine Product Approval Process</h2>
       <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Researchexternal icon (CBER)
      is responsible for regulating vaccines in the United States.

      The sponsor of a new vaccine product follows a multi-step approval process, which typically includes

      An Investigational New Drug application
      Pre-licensure vaccine clinical trials
      A Biologics License Application (BLA)
      Inspection of the manufacturing facility
      Presentation of findings to FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committeeexternal icon
      (VRBPAC)
      Usability testing of product labeling
      After approving a vaccine, FDA continues to oversee its production to ensure continuing safety. Monitoring of the
      vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the
      manufacturer holds a license for the vaccine product.

      FDA can require a manufacturer submit the results of their own tests for potency, safety, and purity for each
      vaccine lot. FDA can require each manufacturer submit samples of each vaccine lot for testing.</p>
